                            Even though CDC recommended the public that wearing a mask would help prevent the spread of COVID-19, 
                            the business owners are the ones to enforce this policy for the safety of the employees and customers.

                        <h4> Under CNN Model?  </h4>
                        <p> 
                            After training our model on the training dataset, we then trained the model on our Validation set and found an accuracy measurement of 95%.
                             We also then tried retraining our model onto the training dataset alongside training the model onto the test datasets and discovered accuracy 
                             measurements of 88% and 95% respectively. Although its slightly concerning that our model performed worse when retraining on itself (primarily 
                             due to overfitting errors, which we address in the report) our findings reveal that our model performs fairly well on unseen data 
                             (both the Validation and Test sets).
                        </p>

                    </div> 
                    <div>
                        <h4> Under Grad-CAM? </h4>
                        <p> Since Grad-CAM is purely for visualization purposes, we decided to provide an example case when running the model on the validation set. 
                            We will briefly go over each image, but if you’re more curious, check out our report where we go over this algorithm in more detail. 
                            The first image is a heatmap generated by Grad-CAM. The mask is the class/object of interest in our model and although Grad-CAM doesn’t provide us labels, 
                            this image is most likely to be classified as correctly worn due to the full coverage of the face. The second image is generated with Grad-CAM and 
                            Guided Backpropagation. What we see in this image are the highlighted pixels of the original image of our model alongside some extra highlighting 
                            due to the findings of Grad-CAM, which reveals some importance to the head, but has the most important pixels around the mask. The last image is generated 
                            solely with Guided Backpropagation. This image reveals the areas of interest through highlighting the pixels of the original image in this altered variation, 
                            which in this case reveals a headshot.

                        <h4>Under Integrated Gradient?</h4> 
                        <p>Likewise, since Integrated Gradients is purely for visualization purposes, we decided to provide an example case when running the model on the validation set. 
                            Again, we will briefly go over each image, but if you’re more curious, check out our report where we go over this algorithm in more detail.  
                            In this example, we see that Integrated Gradients reveals that there are two important individual features/objects, the first being a mask and the second being a face. 
                            The mask is relatively clearer in the second image, mostly because of the importance of highlighting the entire face when detecting it as the object.

                    <div>
                        <p> Our product addressed a current concern shared by people
                            across the world and point out a common bad habit practiced
                            by the general public, which is wearing mask incorrectly
                            and has jeopardized a lot of business. We attempted to
                            mitigate this issue by creating a face mask detector that
                            will help business owners comply with laws and ensure the
                            survival of their business. Moreover, we created the face mask
                            detector to protect business owners, employees,
                            and customers' safety and health during the pandemic. 
                            Our approach to building such a
                            face mask detector is successful and is proven to work in the
                            intended way. We hope that more face mask detectors can be
                            implemented so that business owner can survive in this rather
                            difficult time and that people can protect not only themselves
                            but also others
