                            Explainable AI is a useful algorithm that increases the transparency in machine learning models for
                            evaluation purposes. In our section, we specifically learned about an explainable AI model called
                            Grad-CAM, which is often used to validate the accuracy of image classifiers. We learned about the
                            usefulness of the Grad-CAM algorithm through the replication project, and it inspired us to propose
                            these following ideas for the capstone project. We would like to build a face mask detector using
                            convolutional neural networks and validate its reliablibity using an explainable AI algorithm. We
                            proposed this idea because we are currently in a global pandemic due to the spread of SARSCOVID-19. 
                            The government encourages people to wear masks in the public, and a face mask
                            detector would help to enforce this policy by locating individuals without masks before they enter
                            any facilities. We expect our face mask detector to detect if the person in the image is correctly
                            wearing a mask by covering their nose, chin, and mouth. In addition, we plan to use an explainable
                            AI algorithm to validate the face mask detector to ensure its accuracy.

                        <h4> Why is this Important</h4>
                        <p>
                            The dataset
                            consists of 1376 images with people wearing masks or not. Adrian managed to successfully build a
                            face mask detection tool and achieve tremendous results. However, the dataset only consisted of
                            1376 images, which is fairly small for a dataset used for computer vision tasks. In addition, the
                            dataset only has images with people wearing masks or not. It doesn’t contain images where a
                            person is wearing a mask but not covering his nose or chin. In other words, it doesn’t have images
                            where a person is wearing a mask improperly. We believe that this is a deficiency that is important
                            to address because it is very likely that a lot of people won’t be wearing their masks properly
                            during this ongoing pandemic, and in a situation where this issue becomes serious, such as
                            hosting a public event where everyone is required to wear a mask, it’s essential to incorporate a
                            face mask detector that can not only detect a person is wearing a mask but also whether they are
                            wearing it properly.
